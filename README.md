# nanosam2-cad
# This repo enables version control on the NanoSAM II Structures CAD
# It is designed to simply hold backups that can be opened or rolled back as 
# we make experiemental changes
# This repo SHOULD NOT be used for parallel design where merging changes is necessary,
# as the git merge features do not work well on CAD files.
